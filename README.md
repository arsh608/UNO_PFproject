## Abstract
UNO++ is a C++ console-based adaptation of the beloved card game "UNO." The project focuses on creating an inclusive, immersive, and sustainable gaming environment aligned with several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as innovation, creativity, responsible consumerism, and high-quality education. The game showcases the potential of high-level programming languages and logical thinking to foster ethical and engaging gameplay experiences.

## Introduction
UNO++ brings the nostalgic card game to digital screens, enhancing accessibility and entertainment. By focusing on core gameplay rather than complex storylines, players can experience a fun and challenging game through strategic thinking and key interactions. A random element ensures dynamic gameplay, making each match unique.

## Problem Statement and SDGs
The gaming industry's pursuit of realism often overshadows simple, engaging experiences. UNO++ reintroduces simplicity with meaningful connections to several SDGs:

1. **SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production**  
   Supports sustainable gaming behaviors by avoiding harmful content.

2. **SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being**  
   Promotes mental well-being through strategic gameplay and social interaction.

3. **SDG 4: Quality Education**  
   Enhances problem-solving skills and logical reasoning.

4. **SDG 10: Reduced Inequality**  
   Encourages inclusivity by welcoming diverse players.

5. **SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals**  
   Fosters teamwork and collaboration among players.

## Literature Review
Developing games in C++ demands efficient code, precise use of loops, and correct logic implementation. This project emphasizes robust coding practices, extensive error handling, and a strong understanding of libraries for effective game development. By leveraging the efficiency and flexibility of C++, UNO++ ensures smooth performance and a seamless user experience.

## Project Overview/Goals
The primary objective is to create a fully functional console-based version of the UNO card game. Key features include:

- **Deck Setup:** Generate a deck with numbered cards (0-9) in four colors (red, blue, green, yellow) and special action cards (Skip, Reverse, Draw Two, Wild, Wild Draw Four). Shuffle cards before the game begins.

- **Game Setup:** Support for 1 to 3 players, with options for AI-controlled opponents. Players are dealt seven cards at the start.

- **Gameplay Mechanics:** Players match cards by color, number, or action. Special action cards enforce unique rules. If a player lacks valid cards, they must draw. The "UNO" rule applies when only one card remains.

- **Winning Conditions:** The first player to have zero cards wins.

- **Scoring:** Points are awarded based on opponents' remaining cards at round completion.

- **User Interface:** An intuitive console interface displays cards, discard pile, and relevant messages.

- **Error Handling:** Robust mechanisms to handle invalid inputs and moves.

- **Customization:** Options for adjusting player count and game difficulty. Save and load game functions are available.

## Conclusion
UNO++ successfully delivers a digital recreation of the classic card game. The project emphasizes simplicity, dynamic features, and a user-friendly interface while fostering diversity and social interaction. The inclusion of AI opponents and a point system enriches gameplay. This initiative supports sustainable gaming practices and encourages meaningful player engagement.

## Future Plans
Several avenues for growth and improvement include:

1. **3 Player Multiplayer Mode:** It is under review and updation in C++ file.
2. **Multiplayer Mode:** Enable online multiplayer to connect players globally.
3. **Tournaments and Challenges:** Introduce competitive features to sustain long-term engagement.
4. **Additional Game Modes:** Provide varied gameplay experiences.
5. **Feedback Integration:** Implement a feedback system for user-driven improvements.
6. **AI Intelligence Upgrades:** Enhance AI capabilities for more challenging and dynamic matches.
